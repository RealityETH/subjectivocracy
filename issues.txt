ISSUE: 
 - Token committing
   - need to get people to commit?
   - force committing, tokens only exist on L1 -> can't use them for insurance, other uses
   - committers get fees - may not be enough, eg 10% of fees too little if unclear?
     - first movers get more fees?
   - moving to L2 takes out of staked pool?
 - Token revenue
   - Also get part of fees for transactions? Each block needs a burn? How to regulate how much?
   - Whitelisted arbitrators must pay part of arbitration? 
   - Bond has a burn, but only works if token used for reality.eth 
   - Bond claim fee goes to arbitrators, arbitrator withdrawal must provide a % to tokenholders
      -> other currency also works


 - fees charged on escalations and arbitrations
   - issue: if not in the governance token how to do they get split among token-holders
    - track withdrawal dates
    - auction to burn tokens

 - How to price the MetaArbitrator

 - How to move other tokens owned by the MetaArbitrator
