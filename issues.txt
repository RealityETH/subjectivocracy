 Fork started from that point Day 4
 Governance freeze Day 5, messages start piling up

 Switch to new bridge with different governance

 Governance approves Day 11



Fake transactions sent to bridge

 Day 1 good tx

On fork, how does each fork know which forkmanager it has to listen to?

 bridge on l1 side knows forkmanager address
 bridge on l1 side can switch forkmanager address for special address
 could have a never-changing proxy address to represent all forkmanagers ??


 deployment of a network includes an l1 contract, presumably in its setup params
  - need to check how this works with the actual implementation

 or it has a chainid or something
  -> l1 handles which chainid should be routed to which, ie when we make a new forkmanager we assign a chainid

 or it must know its l1 bridge address (for priority queue etc)
 every priority queue is different 

 next step:
  - check what the deployment for a zksync setup looks like, see if it sets something like chainid or l2bridge
  - 


 Have a single BridgeProxy contract on L1.
 After deploying a new bridge, you must immediately tell the BridgeProxy what ForkManager it will belong to.
  ISSUE: Do we know that at this point?
 OR: tell it the parent ForkManager, that guy can tell it the child



 or
  proxy on l1 side




ISSUE:

 When doing a new bridge deployment, you make the bridge first then ask the ForkManager to call setParent on it
 However how do you stop just anyone from calling setParent against it with a different parent?

 Options
  Make a contract factory rather than specifying the contract
  That way we can call it to mine the contract and be sure we'll be the first to call it

  setParent with the current parent, make a method to updateParent to some child (?)

 
 Alternative flow

  The bridge doesn't know its parent.
  Instead we have a single proxy which knows the parent of each bridge.
  The bridge knows the address of the proxy. It calls it to say, "who is my parent?"



 
 

Passing messages to L2 needs ergsLimit. Can we use a constant for this or does it somehow need to vary? Also do we need L2 gas for this, if so how do we make sure it's funded?
